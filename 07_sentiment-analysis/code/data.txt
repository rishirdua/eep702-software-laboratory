so angry When friends post on Facebook about their shitty situations like, "boohoo, pity me! my life sucks!" and they look for sympathy.... Ugh! It's one thing if uncontrollable circumstances led you to where you are, it's a whole other thing when you have complete control over your situation and you are the same person who tells me you "love attention". NO! I can't feel bad for you, and NO! I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU!!!
You want to feel better? Don't give a sob story expecting people to offer their charity or sympathies. GET OFF YOUR ASS AND DO SOMETHING! LIVE YOUR LIFE!
And for God's sake, don't let some piece of shit control you.
